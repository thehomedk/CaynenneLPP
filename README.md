# CaynenneLPP

## Overview
The Cayenne Low Power Payload (LPP) provides a convenient and easy way to send data over LPWAN networks such as LoRaWAN. The Cayenne LPP is compliant with the payload size restriction, which can be lowered down to 11 bytes, and allows the device to send multiple sensor data at one time.

This work is based on the reference implementation:
